Idle Runner (marathon)

Summary
It's an idle game, but instead of a click equalling a cookie, it equals a(n) [insert short distance here].
As you progress in distance you can go backward a certain distance to buy upgrades.
The main thing to learn here is how the exponential math of idle games works, at least up to the length of a standard marathon.
By limiting the game to a standard marathon length, I'm able to focus on the core mechanics of an idle game and not worry as
much about the issues of extreme late game exponential growth (or the creation of so many upgrades).
1 marathon = 42.195 kilometres
As you run you build up energy, spend the energy on upgrades to run faster and get more energy while progressing to the finish line

Tasks:
* Week 0: Create the "environment" (and fully flesh out the idea by writing this game plan)
* Week 1: Create the UI for progressing the character, i.e. an interface for progressing the idle game and buying upgrades
* Week 2: Create the math to determine incremental upgrades and then how the number of upgrades correlate to the cost
* Week 3: (if not done with above, continue with that. otherwise) start building the scrolling mechanic to the background
* Week 4: Complete the scrolling background mechanic relevant to velocity of player and implement upgrades
* Week 5: Create the animation for the character moving
* Week 6: Design a collection of backgrounds to last the length of a marathon and build them into the game 
* Week 7: Design assets for upgrade buttons
* Week 8: Add achieves that have certain speeds as markers for how fast you're going i.e. Usain Bolt, cheetah, train, superman
* Week 9:
